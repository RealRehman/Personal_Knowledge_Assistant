# How the Application Works

The application has two main parts:

1. **Frontend**
2. **Backend**

The frontend is responsible for the user interface.

The backend is responsible for handling requests, managing conversations, and communicating with the AI model.

The basic flow is:

```text
User
  ↓
Web Browser
  ↓
JavaScript
  ↓
Flask Route
  ↓
Conversation Manager
  ↓
Chat Module
  ↓
Groq API
  ↓
LLM
  ↓
AI Response
  ↓
Flask
  ↓
JavaScript
  ↓
User
```

---

# Backend

## Flask

Flask is used to create the web application and API routes.

The Flask application receives requests from the browser and sends responses back.

For example:

```text
GET / 
```

is used to load the main page.

And:

```text
POST /chat
```

is used to send a chat message to the AI.

---

# `app.py`

`app.py` is the main Flask application file.

Its main responsibilities are:

* Create the Flask application
* Register the route blueprints
* Start the Flask development server

The application is divided into different modules instead of putting all the code inside `app.py`.

This makes the project easier to understand and maintain.

---

# Routes

The Flask routes are stored inside the `routes/` folder.

```text
routes/
├── __init__.py
├── chat_routes.py
└── page_routes.py
```

## `page_routes.py`

This file handles routes related to web pages.

The main page is:

```text
GET /
```

It returns the HTML page used by the AI Assistant.

---

## `chat_routes.py`

This file handles the chat API.

The main endpoint is:

```text
POST /chat
```

The browser sends a request similar to:

```json
{
    "message": "Hello",
    "conversation_id": "chat_2026-08-09_15-30-20"
}
```

The route then:

1. Gets the message
2. Gets the conversation ID
3. Creates a conversation if necessary
4. Loads the previous conversation
5. Adds the new user message
6. Sends the conversation to the AI
7. Gets the AI response
8. Adds the AI response to the conversation
9. Saves the updated conversation
10. Returns the response to the browser

The response looks similar to:

```json
{
    "conversation_id": "chat_2026-08-09_15-30-20",
    "response": "Hello! How can I help you?"
}
```

---

# AI / LLM Integration

## `chat.py`

`chat.py` is responsible for communicating with the Groq API.

The application uses the Groq Python client to send messages to the LLM.

The current model configuration is controlled through `config.py`.

The important idea is that `chat.py` receives the conversation history instead of only receiving the latest user message.

For example:

```python
[
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "My name is Mark."
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Nice to meet you!"
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is my name?"
    }
]
```

The system prompt is added before these messages.

The complete request sent to the LLM is therefore conceptually:

```text
System Prompt
      ↓
Previous User Message
      ↓
Previous AI Response
      ↓
Current User Message
```

This is how our application provides conversation memory to the LLM.

---

# Important: How Conversation Memory Works

The LLM itself does not automatically remember previous API requests.

Our application creates the memory.

The process is:

```text
User Message
     ↓
Store message
     ↓
Save conversation
     ↓
Next request
     ↓
Load conversation
     ↓
Send previous messages + new message to LLM
     ↓
Receive response
     ↓
Save updated conversation
```

For example:

### First message

```text
User:
My name is Mark.
```

The conversation is saved.

### Second message

```text
User:
What is my name?
```

The application loads the previous messages and sends them together to the LLM.

The AI can therefore answer:

```text
Your name is Mark.
```

---

# `conversation_manager.py`

This module manages saved conversations.

It currently provides functions for:

### Creating a conversation

```python
create_conversation()
```

This generates a unique conversation ID based on the current timestamp.

Example:

```text
chat_2026-08-09_15-30-20
```

---

### Saving a conversation

```python
save_conversation(conversation_id, messages)
```

The conversation is stored as a JSON file.

For example:

```text
conversations/
└── chat_2026-08-09_15-30-20.json
```

---

### Loading a conversation

```python
load_conversation(conversation_id)
```

This loads the saved messages from the corresponding JSON file.

---

### Listing conversations

```python
list_conversations()
```

This returns the saved JSON conversation files.

---

# Conversation File Format

A conversation is stored as JSON.

Example:

```json
[
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "My name is Mark."
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Nice to meet you!"
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is my name?"
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Your name is Mark."
    }
]
```

Each message contains:

```text
role
content
```

Possible roles currently used are:

```text
user
assistant
```

The system prompt is added when the conversation is sent to the LLM.

---

# Frontend

The frontend is located in:

```text
templates/
└── index.html

static/
├── script.js
└── style.css
```

---

# `index.html`

The HTML file provides the structure of the AI Assistant interface.

It contains elements such as:

* Chat area
* Message input
* Send button
* Typing indicator
* Header

The page is served by Flask.

---

# `style.css`

This file controls the appearance of the application.

It is responsible for things such as:

* Layout
* Chat bubbles
* User messages
* AI messages
* Header
* Input area
* Buttons
* Animations
* Responsive styling

---

# `script.js`

The JavaScript file connects the frontend to the Flask backend.

It handles:

* Reading the user's message
* Sending messages to `/chat`
* Receiving the AI response
* Displaying messages
* Typing indicator
* Auto-resizing the input
* Enter-to-send
* Smooth scrolling
* Conversation ID

The browser stores the current conversation ID in:

```javascript
let conversationId = null;
```

When the first message is sent, the server creates a conversation ID.

The server sends it back:

```json
{
    "conversation_id": "chat_2026-08-09_15-30-20"
}
```

JavaScript stores this ID and sends it with future messages.

This allows multiple messages to belong to the same conversation.

---

# Configuration

## `config.py`

Configuration values are kept separately from the main application code.

The project currently uses configuration values such as:

```text
GROQ_API_KEY
MODEL
TEMPERATURE
MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS
```

This allows the AI configuration to be changed without modifying the main chat logic.

---

# System Prompt

## `system_prompt.py`

The system prompt contains the instructions given to the AI before the conversation.

The purpose of the system prompt is to define how the assistant should behave.

The application sends the system prompt along with the conversation history.

Conceptually:

```text
System Prompt
      +
Conversation History
      ↓
      LLM
      ↓
AI Response
```

---

# Console Application

## `console_app.py`

Before building the Flask application, we created a console version of the AI assistant.

It allows the user to interact with the AI through the terminal.

Example:

```text
============================================================
          Console AI Assistant
============================================================
Type 'exit' to quit.

You: Hello
AI: Hello! How can I help you?

You: What is Python?
AI: Python is a programming language...
```

The console application helped us understand the basic AI/API flow before moving to Flask.

---

# Utilities

## `utils.py`

`utils.py` contains helper functions that can be reused by different parts of the application.

Keeping helper functions in a separate file prevents the same code from being repeated throughout the project.

This file will become more useful as the application grows.

---

# Logging

## `logger.py`

The project contains a logging module.

Logs are stored in:

```text
logs/
└── chatbot.log
```

Logging allows the application to record information about what is happening.

For example:

```text
Application started
Chat request received
Conversation loaded
AI response generated
Error occurred
```

Logging is different from displaying information to the user.

The user should receive a simple message, while the log can contain technical information useful for debugging.

---

# Requirements

The Python packages required by the project are stored in:

```text
requirements.txt
```

To install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment.

Create one:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it on Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# API Key

The application requires a Groq API key.

The key should **not** be hard-coded into the source code or committed to GitHub.

Use an environment variable or the configuration method already used by the project.

For example:

```text
GROQ_API_KEY
```

Make sure your API key is kept private.

---

# Running the Application

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Start Flask:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask development server should start on:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Open that address in your browser.

---

# Testing the Current Application

## Test 1 — Open the Web Application

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

The AI Assistant interface should appear.

---

## Test 2 — Send a Message

Enter:

```text
Hello
```

The application should return an AI response.

---

## Test 3 — Test Conversation Memory

Send:

```text
My name is Mark.
```

Then send:

```text
What is my name?
```

The AI should remember the previous message and answer correctly.

---

## Test 4 — Check Saved Conversation

Open:

```text
conversations/
```

A JSON file should have been created.

Example:

```text
chat_2026-08-09_15-30-20.json
```

The file should contain the conversation messages.

---

# Current API

## `GET /`

Loads the main AI Assistant web page.

### Response

HTML page.

---

## `POST /chat`

Sends a message to the AI.

### Request

```json
{
    "message": "Hello",
    "conversation_id": null
}
```

For an existing conversation:

```json
{
    "message": "What did I say earlier?",
    "conversation_id": "chat_2026-08-09_15-30-20"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
    "conversation_id": "chat_2026-08-09_15-30-20",
    "response": "Hello! How can I help you?"
}
```

---

# Current Architecture

# Current Limitations

The current version is working, but it is still an early version of the application.

Some areas still need improvement.

### 1. Error Handling

The current error handling is basic.

The application needs better handling for:

* Groq API errors
* Network errors
* Invalid requests
* Missing data
* File errors
* Invalid conversation IDs

---

### 2. Conversation Management UI

Conversations are currently stored as JSON files, but there is not yet a proper interface for:

* Creating named conversations
* Listing conversations
* Switching between conversations
* Deleting conversations
* Renaming conversations

---

### 3. Database

The application currently uses JSON files for conversation storage.

Later, we can move to a database such as SQLite.

---

### 4. Authentication

There is currently no user authentication.

The application is currently designed as a local personal assistant.

---

### 5. Testing

Automated tests still need to be added.

---

# Planned Development

The project will be developed step by step.

The next planned improvements are:

```text
Current Working Application
          ↓
Better Error Handling
          ↓
Better Logging
          ↓
Input Validation
          ↓
Conversation Management
          ↓
API Improvements
          ↓
Automated Testing
          ↓
Database
          ↓
Knowledge / Document Features
          ↓
Personal Knowledge Assistant
```

The final goal is to turn this into a **Personal Knowledge Assistant** that can work with the user's own information and documents.

---

# Development Philosophy

This project is being built step by step rather than creating everything at once.

Each new feature should:

1. Have a clear purpose
2. Use concepts already learned where possible
3. Be tested before moving forward
4. Keep the project structure clean
5. Avoid unnecessary complexity

The goal is not only to build the application, but also to understand **why each part exists and how the parts communicate with each other**.

---
